        <h1>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h1>

        <p>This webpage is about the basics of html, I recommand you to download Visual Studio Code if you want to practis your programming, you can always inspect the page if you want to see how this page was made, you might see some css and javascript which you might not be familiar with but we will talk about that soon</p>

        <h1>Intro To HTML</h1>

        <p class="Introduction">
            <strong>!DOCTYPE html</strong>         
        </p>

        <p>So first, when you are writing a webpage, you should always start with a <strong class="Introduction">!DOCTYPE html </strong> tag showing that the webpage was written is modern html, not those weird old types of html. It is written between <em>smaller than</em> and <em>greater than</em> signs like this (inspect and see whats there) all tags start with a less than sign and end with greater than sign                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
            <!--   <!DOCTYPE html>   this is the !DOCTYPE html tag if you inspected the page you should see this comment-->
        </p>

        <p class="Introduction">
            <strong>html and /html</strong>
        </p>

        <p>After the <strong class="Introduction">!DOCTYPE html</strong> tag there will be a <strong class="Introduction">html</strong> tag(REMEMBER that tags ALWAYS start with a smaller than sign and end with a greater than sign) we have a pair of <strong class="Introduction">html</strong> tags,there is a start tag like this <strong class="Introduction">html</strong> and the end tag is like this <strong class="Introduction">/html</strong>.The start tag comes straight after the<strong class="Introduction">!DOCTYPE html</strong> tag and the end tag comes at the end of everything, it ends the whole html and also remember all end tags has a slash like this <strong class="Introduction">/html</strong></p>
        
        <p class="Introduction">
            <strong>head and /head</strong>
        </p>

        <p>The <strong class="Introduction">head</strong> tag comes in pairs just like the <strong class="Introduction">html</strong> tags, it is used for the <strong class="Introduction">title</strong> tags and the <strong class="Introduction">meta</strong> tag.</p>
        
        <p class="Introduction">
            <strong>meta charset="UTF-8"</strong>
        </p>

        <p>The meta charset="UTF-8" tag is inside the <strong class="Introduction">head tag</strong> it doesn't come in pairs.It is used to specify that the webpage is in English so if you are planning the page to be in Chinese you should probably consider changing the UTF-8 into something else.</p>


        <p class="Introduction">
            <strong>title and /title</strong>
        </p>

        <p>The title tags is also inside the head tag, inside the title tags is the title of your webpage which shows the on the tabs on top of browsers for example, if you inspected the page you will see the title is HTML: HyperText Markup Language and it shows on the tab of this webpage</p>

        <p class="Introduction">
            <strong>body and /body</strong>
        </p>

        <p>The <strong class="Introduction">body</strong> tags contain the part of the webpage that we can see. It's end tag comes just before the <strong class="Introduction">html's</strong>end tag.</p>

        <p>Now that all the essential elements needed to start the webpage have been introduced, we can talk about what goes inside the body tag, which are the tags that make up the webpage. you should have something like this after you are ready to get some information inside the page:<br>
            !DOCTYPE html<br>
            html<br>
            head<br>
                meta charset="UTF-8"<br>
                title /title<br>
            /head<br>
            body<br>
                
            /body<br>
            /html<br>
        </p>
        
        <h1>"H" tags</h1>

        <p>When you are done with all the set up of the page, we have a webpage, but this web page isn't that exciting; it's blank, there is nothing except the title on the tab.So now we use the "H" tags, there is <strong class="Introduction">h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6</strong>. They come in different sizes and normally we use <strong class="Introduction">h1</strong> for the heading of the page, the font-sixe gets smaller as the number increases</p>

        <ul>

            <li><h1>The size of h1</h1></li>
            <li><h2>The size of h2</h2></li>
            <li><h3>The size of h3</h3></li>
            <li><h4>The size of h4</h4></li>
            <li><h5>The size of h5</h5></li>
            <li><h6>The size of h6</h6></li>

        </ul>

        <h1>The "P" tag</h1>
        <p>After introducing the <strong class="Introduction">h tags</strong> you might want to use smaller <strong class="Introduction">h tags</strong> for the text, but I do not recomand that beacause:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>It is hard to find a size when using h tags for text</li>
            <li>There is a specific tag for that</li>
            <li>It is an abuse to the h tag</li>
            <li>It is also an abuse to the p tag</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So, the <strong class="Introduction">p tag</strong> is used for writting the text and basically thats all. If use inspected the page you will find that most of the text, including the one you are readng right now is written using the <strong class="Introduction">p tag</strong></p>

        <h1>"em" and "strong"</h1>

        <p>After being able to get some words down in to a web page, you might wonder what you can do if you want to express a part of your text strongly, what should you do? Well, you could get the "strong" and "em" tags in use. The "em" tag is used the emphasis the text, it will make the text in it <em>Italic</em> just like the word "Italic". The strong tag is used to make the text <strong>bold</strong> like the word "blod" is.</p>

        <h1>"Lists"</h1>
        
        <P>A list can help us by making a list..............Okay, what it does is like what I did for the <strong class="Introduction">H tags</strong>, I made the bullet points. It doesn't have to be bullet points, you can also make them numbers like what I did for the <strong class="Introduction">p tag</strong> for bullet points you will have to use the <strong class="Introduction">ul tag</strong> which stands for: "un-ordered list" and for numbers, you use the <strong class="Introduction">ol tag</strong> which stands for "ordered list" between them, goes the <strong class="Introduction">li tag</strong> which stands for "list" what you want in the list goes inside that tag; for example: if I wanted top 3 most smart animals I could do this: <strong class="Introduction">ol tag</strong> <strong class="Introduction">li tag</strong>Nothing<strong class="Introduction">li end tag</strong> <strong class="Introduction">li tag</strong> I don't know <strong class="Introduction">li end tag</strong> <strong class="Introduction">li tag</strong> Not me <strong class="Introduction">li end tag</strong> you can also use the <strong class="Introduction">ul tag</strong> like the one I did down here</P>

        <h3>Why Github is a helpful</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Because I don't know</li>
            <li>Because I really don't know</li>
            <li>Because I just don't know!</li>
            <li>Because........em...........</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>The "br" tag</h1>

        <p>In <strong class="Introduction">html</strong> the system doesn't consider the line and spaces in the text so if I were to write a poem, something like this will happen: 
            I don't know how to write a poem
            I don't know how to write a poem
            I don't know how to write a poem
            I don't know how to write a poem
            You can see that in the html I spaced up for the poem but in the webpage it is all crushed up together, so now we use the <strong class="Introduction">br tag</strong> it stands for "break". it doesn't have an end tag and you use it just by putting it at the end of what ever you what to break off to just like this:<br>
            I don't know how to write a poem<br>
            I don't know how to write a poem<br>
            I don't know how to write a poem<br>
            I don't know how to write a poem<br>
            And as you see the poem has line breaks</p>

        <h1>Links</h1>
    
        <p>You have probably hear of links before, whenever you click on them they take you to that webpage and here is how it is done: first you need an <strong class="Introduction">a tag</strong> and dirctly after the letter "a" in the tag don't close the tag type <strong class="Introduction">href=""</strong> which means Hyper-reference and between the two <strong class="Introduction">"" 's</strong> type the url of the webpage and close the tag, then, type what you want to click to take you to that page: it can be a sentense or an image or anything else you can think of and then, comes the end tag; let me show you what I mean</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?hl=zh-cn"> To go to youtube</a>

        <h1>Images</h1>

        <p>When introducing links I told you about images, so how can you insert images on a webpage? You use the <strong class="Introduction">img tag</strong> it doesn't have an end tag so you type everything inside the img tag. after <strong class="Introduction">img</strong> you type <strong class="Introduction">src=""</strong> and inside the quotation marks you type the url of the image and the url of an image usally ends in .png or .jng and other more. <strong>It can only be an image in your browser</strong>like the one that can be seen on google</strong></p>

        <h4>So now, the very basics of html has been introduced to you. You can now create your own webpage if you have an application like VSCode for doing that you can always keep exploring with other websites by simply inspecting them.</h4>
